## Code of conduct

- We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
- Please be kind and courteous. Thereâ€™s no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behaviour. 
- Likewise, spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.

This code of conduct is adapted (mostly shortened) from the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).
